# Calculator-using-Python

This project involves designing and creating _a simple calculator_ with GUI (i.e, graphical user  interface) which can perform basic arithmetic operation like addition, subtraction,  multiplication or division depending upon the user input.

_**Implementation Details**_

Python offers many options for developing a GUI, among those options, Tkinter is used in this project. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI 
applications. 

While creating any GUI Application there are mainly two steps: 

    1.The first step is to create a User Interface. 
  
    2.The second step is the most important one and in this, to add functionalities to the GUI. 
  
There are a variety of functions in Tkinter with the help of them it becomes easy and convenient to make a simple calculator just with this little code. 

Consider a Simple Algorithm given below.

**ALGORITHM-**

    1.Import everything from the Tkinter using *. 

    2.Create an interface for the calculator. 

    3.Create an input function that enters a number into the input field. 

    4.Create an apparent function that wipes everything from the input field. 

    5.And finally, evaluate function that computes and gives the result of the expression. 

We have an Input Field in which the user input will be shown and the final result of the 
calculation will be displayed.

And the buttons are like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, -, *, /, =, ., and C(clear button).

Following is  the view of the GUI of the calculator-
